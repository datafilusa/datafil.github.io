    <div class="aboutuspara1"><p> DATAFIL LLC was created and registered in the US state of Wyoming on November 3rd, 2021.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aboutuspara2"> <p> <span class="firstwordpara2">Amidst</span> a surge of foreign students heading to the Philippines to pursue medical studies, there was an observable need of academic guidance, career counseling, and support in navigating day-to-day challenges. Recognizing this, founders Scott Wallace and Prajjwal Tamang, both holders of Doctor of Medicine degrees, decided to leverage their own strengths and core competencies and bridge these gaps by fusing their business acumen with their medical backgrounds.

      <div class="abtuspara2"><span class="firstwordpara22">With</span> a vision to provide comprehensive support tailored to aspiring medical professionals, they agreed to create a platform that harmonized student placement services whilst simultaneously providing medical expertise. Thus, the concept of a pathway to medicine was realized. Through this union, the company endeavors to empower international medical students with an accessible route to pursue their dreams of practicing medicine in the United States of America. Moreover, recognizing the growing demand for assistance among international students interested in various fields such as business administration, engineering, and dentistry, the founders expanded their services. Responding to persistent requests for guidance and aid from the international student community, Datafil began offering support for courses in business administration, hospitality management, dentistry, engineering, and aviation in the Philippines</div>
      
      <div class="abtuspara3"><span class="firstwordpara23">Operating</span> across the globe with offices in the USA, India, Nepal, Malaysia, and the Philippines, our international presence and steadfast commitment enables personalized support to each of our clients. We aim to offer a holistic support system that nurtures the aspirations of international students, ensuring they are equipped with the resources and guidance needed to thrive in their academic and professional journeys.
